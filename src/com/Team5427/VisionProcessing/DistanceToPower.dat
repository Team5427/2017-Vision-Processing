/**
 * This file will be used to store all of the data that will be used by the targeting program in our 
 * robot. The program will take the distance from the tower and then compare it to the following table
 * and the determine how fast to set the fly wheels. The purpose of doing this is in order to avoid
 * having to redo complex calculations over and over again in short amounts of time. all distances are in inches.
